        <h1>COVID-19 Data As Rigidbody Cubes</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            COVID-19 data is represented as rigidbody cubes in a scene. The project was created to help me learn how to use HTTP requests in Godot Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the given parameters are:
            <ul>
                <li>Total Cases</li>
                <li>Total Deaths</li>
                <li>Total Tests</li>
                <li>Recovered</li>
                <li>Critical</li>
                <li>Active</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The project uses a RapidAPI to get the data from the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193/">COVID-19 API by API-SPORTS</a>. It sorts the data by country, cases, deaths, and tests.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The controls are:
            <ul>
                <li>Space - Pull towards a point</li>
                <li>B - Explode away from a point</li>
                <li>F - Freeze the cubes</li>
                <li>R - Reset the cubes</li>
                <li>Z - Toggle gravity</li>
                <li>X - Sword</li>
                <li>Move mouse - Rotate the camera slightly</li>
                <li>Left mouse button - Interact with UI</li>
                <li>C - Change camera mode</li>
                <li>M - Move camera toggle (mode 1)</li>
                <li>WASD - Move camera (mode 1, move camera toggle on)</li>
                <li>QE - Rotate on Z-axis (mode 1, move camera toggle on)</li>
                <li>Mouse - Rotate on XY-axises (mode 1, move camera toggle on)</li>
            </ul>

            You can <em>try</em> to run it on <a href="html5/covidcubes.html">your browser in HTML5</a>. Because it is in GLES3, it will not work on mobile devices and could be slow.
